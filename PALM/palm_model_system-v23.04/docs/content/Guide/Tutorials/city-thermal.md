!!! warning
    This site is  Work in Progress.

- Basic idea: make a simulation of a city to analyse the thermal conditions
- Road map
  - create drivers
    - use palm_csd to create static driver
    - use inifor to create dynamic driver
  - create setup
    - description of parameters in example p3d file
    - initial/boundary conditions etc...
  - run setup, explain if special tasks must be performed
  - tips for analysis
