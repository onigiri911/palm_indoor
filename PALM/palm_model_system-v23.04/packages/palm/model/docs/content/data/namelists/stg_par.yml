# This is the YAML Database file for all allowed parameters within the namelist "stg_par"

boundary_layer_depth:
  category: general Settings
  type: R
  default:
    value: 1000.0
  si-uni: m
  description:
    short: Prescribed boundary-layer depth.

compute_velocity_seeds_local:
  category: Numerics
  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description:
    short: Switch to decide whether velocity seeds are computed locally or distributed over several processes.
    long: |
      If *.F.*, the computation of the velocity seeds is done in parallel by multiple processes.
      This requires additional MPI communication to gather the calculated seeds on the respective processes responsible for the boundaries.
      This option is especially useful for large length scales where the computational effort can become huge (when computation of velocity seeds requires more time than MPI communication).
      If *.T.*, velocity seeds are computed only locally and no MPI communication is necessary. This performs better when the turbulent length scales are small (when MPI communication requires more time than computation).

dt_stg_adjust:
  category: General Settings
  type: R
  default:
    value: 1800.0
  si-unit: s
  description:
    short: Time interval for adjusting turbulence statistics.
    long: |
      The turbulence statistics define the amplitude and sign of imposed correlations.
      [dt_stg_adjust](#stg_par--dt_stg_adjust) only comes into effective if turbulence statistics are parametrized, i.e. if they are not read from the ASCII input file [STG_PROFILES](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/attachment/wiki/doc/app/iofiles/STG_PROFILES). Furthermore, [dt_stg_adjust](#stg_par--dt_stg_adjust) is only relevant in the case of a daily cycle, where the strength of turbulence and boundary-layer depth changes in time.

dt_stg_call:
  category: General Settings
  type: R
  default:
    value: 0.0
  si-unit: s
  description:
    short: Time interval for calling synthetic turbulence generator.
    long: |
      Per default, the turbulence generator is called every time step (called every 0.0 seconds). Increasing [dt_stg_call](#stg_par--dt_stg_call) may help to reduce computational time.

switch_off_module:
  category: General Settings
  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description:
    short: Switch to turn on/off the module.
    long: |
      If *.T.*, the synthetic turbulence generator is not activated even if the namelist is present in the parameter file.
