In case of an inclined surface (see [alpha_surface](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--alpha_surface)) the buoyancy term appears in the equation of motion of the w-component and u-component. There is no buoyancy term implemented for the v-component as the surface can only be inclined in x-direction and no buoyancy term is required for the v-component. This should not happen.

  description: |
    The initial mixing ratio in an initial run must not exceed its saturation mixing ratio by more than 2 percent. Higher values are physically unrealistic and not observed in the atmosphere. In case that cloud physics are considered, oversaturation would create strong convection leading to unpredictable model behavior. Further, oversaturated mixing ratios have implications in the land-surface model, where moisture might condense immediately at the surface, creating very high surface fluxes. Please check humidity settings, e.g. in the static driver file.

  description: |
    The water vapor mixing ratio exceeds its saturation value. In case condensation processes are switched-on by using the bulk-cloud model, this is usually no issue because water vapor is removed. However, in case no condensation processes are enabled, the physical setup might become unrealistic. Depending on the level of supersaturation, the buoyancy term can become unrealistic. Further, in case of the land- or urban-surface model, water vapor is partly removed at the surface due to dew formation, which can become unrealistically large, yielding to unrealistic sensible and latent surface heat fluxes, potentially even causing simulation crashes. If this warning pops-up, please check your results carefully.

    grid coarsening on subdomain level cannot be performed
  description: |
    The multigrid pressure solver ([psolver](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--psolver) = *'multigrid'*) halves the number of grid points in each direction to get coarser grid levels. This is done for the subdomain grid on each PE until one of the directions cannot be divided by 2 without rest. After this is the case, the coarsest grid level of each subdomain are gathered on each PE for further coarsening. Before gathering, the coarsening must be done for the subdomain at least one time. This error messages appears for example with the following combination:
    
    [nx](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--nx) = *60*, [ny](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--ny) = *60*, [nz](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--nz) = *60*, [npex](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--npex) = *4*, [npey](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--npey) = *2*
    
    With this combination, the subdomain on each PE has the size `nx_s` = *15*, `ny_s` = *30*, `nz_s` = *60*. The number of grid points in the x-direction of the subdomain cannot be divided by 2 and no coarsening is possible for the subdomains in this example. To avoid this error ensure that the number of grid points on the subdomain of an PE in each direction can be divided by 2 without rest at least one time. Therefore, vary the number of grid points for the direction which does not fit by changing [nx](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--nx), [ny](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--ny), or [nz](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--nz), or adjust the number of processors by modifying [npex](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--npex) or [npey](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--npey) in order to get other subdomain sizes.
    
    For the example given above, the error can be avoided e.g. by setting [nx](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--nx) = *64*, which leads to a subdomain of `nx_s` = *16*, `ny_s` = *30*, `nz_s` = *60*. All numbers are now divisible by 2 without rest, and the first coarser grid level on the subdomain then consists of (8, 15, 30) grid points along (x, y, z).

This may happen for very large grids, where the grid point numbers along `x`, `y`, `z` are given by 2^n^ with n > 10. The smallest grid which may cause this error would have 2048^3^ points. However, depending on the chosen domain decomposition, much larger grids might be possible.

    Still after 1000 cycles of the iterative multigrid-Poisson-solver (see [psolver](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--psolver) = *'multigrid'*) the residual (remaining divergence of the flow field) is larger than the residual limit given by [residual_limit](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--residual_limit). Try to increase the residual limit, or limit the number of multigrid cycles (see [mg_cycles](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--mg_cycles)). In any case, carefully check if the divergence of the velocity field is sufficiently reduced by the multigrid solver. This can be done by comparing the divergence before and after the call of the multigrid solver, which is printed in the `<run-id>_rc` file (local filename [RUN_CONTROL](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/app/iofiles#RUN_CONTROL)).

    **Important**: Due to the large number of complex reasons it should be noted that the following list is not complete, but it is intended to give general hints how to proceed in case of this error message. There are various reasons for this message to appear. In general, it just means that the simulation became unstable.
    
    First, check for an unrealistic value of [dt_max](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--dt_max) in the namelist file. Setups with very small grid spacings may require to reduce [dt_max](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--dt_max). The error message may also indicate unrealistic settings of e.g. boundary conditions or other namelist parameters. Please also check if this error appears if you run without user interface code. In case the land surface model or the urban surface model is employed, surface temperatures may have become unstable during the time-integration. One known issue is e.g. the presence of metal surfaces `pavement_type = 7`, where the integration of surface tempertures can become unstable, producing unrealistically high or low surface sensible heat fluxes. Please check for possibly mis-represented settings in your static input file.
