If this is the case, the coarsest grid level of each subdomain are gathered on each PE for further coarsening. Before gathering, the coarsening must be done for the subdomain at least one time. You get this error messages for example with the following combination: \\ [../initialization_parameters#nx  nx ] = 60, [../initialization_parameters#ny  ny ] = 60, [../initialization_parameters#nz  nz ] = 60, \\ [../runtime_parameters#npex  npex ] = 4, [../runtime_parameters#npey  npey ] = 2. \\ With this combination, the subdomain on each PE has the size: \\ nx = 15, ny = 30, nz = 60. \\ The number of grid points in the x-direction of the subdomain cannot be divided by 2 and no coarsening is possible for the subdomains in this example. \\\\ To avoid this error ensure that the number of grid points in each direction can be divided by 2 without rest on the subdomain of an PE at least one time. Therefor vary the number of grid points for the direction which does not fit by changing [../initialization_parameters#nx  nx ], [../initialization_parameters#ny  ny ] or [../initialization_parameters#nz  nz ] or adjust the number of processors by modifying the parameters [../runtime_parameters#npex  npex ] or [../runtime_parameters#npey  npey ] in order to get other subdomain sizes. \\ In the example given above, you can avoid the error by changing nx or npex. For example setting [../initialization_parameters#nx  nx ] = 64 leads to a subdomain of \\ nx = 16, ny = 30, nz = 60. \\ All numbers are now divisible by 2 without rest and the first coarser grid on the subdomain is then: \\ nx = 8, ny = 15, nz = 30. ||

Moreover, this error message may indicate for unrealistic settings of e.g. [../initialization_parameters#bc boundary conditions] or other NAMELIST parameters. For very small vertical grid spacing [../initialization_parameters#dz dz] this error might also occur if [../initialization_parameters#roughness_length roughness_length] >= [../initialization_parameters#dz dz]. Please also check if this error appears if you run without USERCODE. To compile and run the PALM and USERCODE with DEBUG-options might also give sometimes valuable hints. In case the [../land_surface_parameters land-surface model] or the [../urban_surface_parameters building-surface model] is employed, surface temperatures might had become unstable during the time-integration. One known issue is e.g. the presence of metal surfaces {{{pavement_type = 7}}}, where the integration of surface tempertures can become unstable, producing unrealistically high or low surface sensible heat fluxes.
