    turbulent_inflow_method = "..." requires a Dirichlet condition at the inflow boundary
  description: |
    In case of turbulent inflow the turbulence signal is added to a time-constant horizontal mean wind profile at the left inflow boundary at each timestep. The use of a time-constant mean wind profile requires a Dirichlet boundary condition at the left inflow boundary. For see [non-cyclic boundary conditions](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/tec/noncyclic) as well as [turbulent inflow](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/app/examples/turbinf) for further information.

In order to limit the input size to avoid any memory exceedance, the size of input boundary data is limited to a maximum of two three-dimensional arrays. Try to change the domain-decomposition along the x-dimension e.g. via [npex](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--npex).
