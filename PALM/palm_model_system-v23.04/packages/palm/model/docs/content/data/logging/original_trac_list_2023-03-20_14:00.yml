  message: grid coarsening on subdomain level cannot be performed
  description: 'The multigrid pressure solver halfs the number of grid points in each direction to get coarser grid levels. This is done for the subdomains on each PE until one of the directions cannot be divided by 2 without rest. If this is the case, the coarsest grid level of each subdomain are gathered on each PE for further coarsening. Before gathering, the coarsening must be done for the subdomain at least one time. You get this error messages for example with the following combination: \\ [../initialization_parameters#nx  nx ] = 60, [../initialization_parameters#ny  ny ] = 60, [../initialization_parameters#nz  nz ] = 60, \\ [../runtime_parameters#npex  npex ] = 4, [../runtime_parameters#npey  npey ] = 2. \\ With this combination, the subdomain on each PE has the size: \\ nx = 15, ny = 30, nz = 60. \\ The number of grid points in the x-direction of the subdomain cannot be divided by 2 and no coarsening is possible for the subdomains in this example. \\\\ To avoid this error ensure that the number of grid points in each direction can be divided by 2 without rest on the subdomain of an PE at least one time. Therefor vary the number of grid points for the direction which does not fit by changing [../initialization_parameters#nx  nx ], [../initialization_parameters#ny  ny ] or [../initialization_parameters#nz  nz ] or adjust the number of processors by modifying the parameters [../runtime_parameters#npex  npex ] or [../runtime_parameters#npey  npey ] in order to get other subdomain sizes. \\ In the example given above, you can avoid the error by changing nx or npex. For example setting [../initialization_parameters#nx  nx ] = 64 leads to a subdomain of \\ nx = 16, ny = 30, nz = 60. \\ All numbers are now divisible by 2 without rest and the first coarser grid on the subdomain is then: \\ nx = 8, ny = 15, nz = 30.'

  description: The time step is determined according to the CFL criterion to assure a stable numerical solution. This error message means that the required minimum time step, determined from the three velocity components, is several orders of magnitude smaller than [../runtime_parameters#dt_max dt_max], or, in other words, that at least one of the velocity components got too large. Due to the large number of complex reasons it should be noted that this list is not complete, but it is intended to give general hints how to proceed in case of this error message. First, check for a unrealistic value of [../runtime_parameters#dt_max dt_max] in the NAMELIST file. Moreover, this error message may indicate for unrealistic settings of e.g. [../initialization_parameters#bc boundary conditions] or other NAMELIST parameters. For very small vertical grid spacing [../initialization_parameters#dz dz] this error might also occur if [../initialization_parameters#roughness_length roughness_length] >= [../initialization_parameters#dz dz]. Please also check if this error appears if you run without USERCODE. To compile and run the PALM and USERCODE with DEBUG-options might also give sometimes valuable hints. In case the [../land_surface_parameters land-surface model] or the [../urban_surface_parameters building-surface model] is employed, surface temperatures might had become unstable during the time-integration. One known issue is e.g. the presence of metal surfaces {{{pavement_type = 7}}}, where the integration of surface tempertures can become unstable, producing unrealistically high or low surface sensible heat fluxes.  Please check for possibly mis-represented settings in your static input file. List to be continued.

Because of the staggered grid, the distance between these two points is half of the grid spacing in the respective direction, i.e. {{{dz/2}}} in vertical direction. The height {{{z = dz/2}}} defines the top of the (analytical) logarithmic layer {{{z_mo}}} (the surface layer height). Functions like {{{ln(z_mo/z0)}}}, where {{{z0}}} is the roughness length, are used to calculate characteristic surface layer variables like u* or theta*. This mathematically requires that {{{z_mo > z0}}}, or in other words, that {{{z0 < dz/2}}}. In case you have run into this error, you either need to reduce the roughness length {{{z0}}} (via namelist parameter roughness_length or in the static driver) or enlarge the grid spacing {{{dz}}}. Same holds for roughness length {{{z0h}}} for temperature and {{{z0q}}} for moisture. \\ \\ '''Attention:''' This message is given only once (for the first grid point where the exceedance has been detected).

Keep in mind that just providing a NetCDF4 library is not sufficient. You also need to re-compile the PALM code with preprocessor directive {{{-D__netcdf4}}} and runtime parameter [wiki:doc/app/runtime_parameters#netcdf_data_format netcdf_data_format] set to 4.

  message: Mesoscale nesting requires initializing_actions = "read_from_file".
  description: If lateral and top boundary conditions are obtained from a mesoscale model simulation, the initial profiles of the velocity components, potential temperature and mixing ratio need to be in line with the mesoscale data. As boundary conditions from mesoscale model data are handed over via the dynamic input file, the initial profiles should also handed over this way. If other initial data is used instead, this could result in large discrepancies between the initial data and the boundary data at the inflow boundaries, which can lead to strong numerical oscillations. In particular for the mixing ratio, this could produce even values close to zero or supersaturated conditions, possibly leading to numerical instabilities in conjunction with the energy-balance schemes.

  description: The water vapor mixing ratio exceeds its saturation value. In case condensation processes are switched-on by using the bulk-cloud model, this is usually no issue because water vapor is removed. However, in case no condensation processes are enabled, the physical setup might become unrealistic. Depending on the level of supersaturation, the buoyancy term can become unrealistic. Further, in case of the land- or urban-surface model, water vapor is partly removed at the surface due to dew formation, which can become unrealistically large, yielding to unrealistic sensible and latent surface heat fluxes, potentially even causing simulation crashes. If this warning pops-up, please check your results carefully.
