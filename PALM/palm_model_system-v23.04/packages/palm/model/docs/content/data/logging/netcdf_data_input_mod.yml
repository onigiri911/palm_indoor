  description: |
    Each location where a building is set requires a type ( and vice versa ) in case the urban-surface model is applied.

    Apart from the obvious inconsistent setting of building input data, please check if building_id has reasonable numbers. Even though building_id's can be set arbitrary, only values representable on a 32-bit integer can be used. For ids that cannot be represented, errors in the building processing can happen, causing this error. Another reason could be that the model domain is too shallow and thus the building and surface classification does not work properly.

  description: |
    If the variable building_surface_pars has been specified within a static driver, the coordinates xs/ys/zs define the location of a horizontal/vertical buildings surface, while zenith/azimuth define the orientantion of the surface (upward-, northward-, southward-, eastward-, westward-facing). In case this error message appears, the coordinates xs, ys, zs, zenith, and azimuth describing a surface element do not match with the location of a building. Even if xs, ys, zs, are prescribed correctly, mismatches in zenith and azimuth may cause this error. In such a case, please check carefully your pre-processor code that you used to create the static driver.
