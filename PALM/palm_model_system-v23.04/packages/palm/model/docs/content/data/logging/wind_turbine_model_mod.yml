  description: |
    The implemented wind turbine model does not consider a stretched grid. Therefore grid stretching should only be applied well above the region where the wind turbine model is active. Please adjust [dz_stretch_level_start](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--dz_stretch_level_start) accordingly.

  message: |
    Wind turbine model output requires netCDF version 4. No output file will be created.
  description: |
    Data output for the wind turbine model is realized only for netCDF version 4. As a consequence the model output is deactivated if version 3 is used. Keep in mind that just providing a netCDF4 library is not sufficient. You also need to re-compile the PALM code with preprocessor option `-D__netcdf4` (to be set in the `%cpp_options` line of the configuration file) and to set [netcdf_data_format](../Namelists/#runtime_parameters--netcdf_data_format) = *4*.
