  message: |
    wrong component: ...
  description: |
    This message is generated by the procedure `pcm_tendency` of the plant canopy model, which calculates drag for velocity components and scalar quantities. The calculated components are: `u`, `v`, `w`, `pt`, `q`, `e`, `s` (1-7). The subroutine is only called for these 7 quantities. The error means that the routine is probably called from the user-interface for a non-defined component. Either adjust the user-interface, or routines `pcm_tendency` and `pcm_tendency_ij` in file `plant_canopy_model_mod.f90`. If no user-interface is used, contact the PALM devekopers, e.g. via the trouble-ticket system.
