  description: |
    If lateral and top boundary conditions are obtained from a mesoscale model simulation, the initial profiles of the velocity components, potential temperature and mixing ratio need to be in line with the mesoscale data. As boundary conditions from mesoscale model data are handed over via the dynamic input file, the initial profiles should also handed over this way. If other initial data is used instead, this could result in large discrepancies between the initial data and the boundary data at the inflow boundaries, which can lead to strong numerical oscillations. In particular for the mixing ratio, this could produce even values close to zero or supersaturated conditions, possibly leading to numerical instabilities in conjunction with the energy-balance schemes.

  description: |
    In case of mesoscale (offline) nesting the boundary data can be provided as level-of-detail (LOD) 1 or as LOD 2. However, a mixture of both in one simulation is not possible.
