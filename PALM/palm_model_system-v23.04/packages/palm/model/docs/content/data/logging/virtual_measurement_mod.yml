    virtual measurements require parallel netCDF.
  description: |
    If virtual measurements are taken, the PALM code need to be compiled with parallel netCDF support by setting preprocessor switches `-D__netcdf -D__netcdf4 -D__netcdf4_parallel` in the `%cpp_options` line of the configuration file.

  description: |
    When virtual measurements are taken, data is sampled at given station grid coordinates. It is possible that also the adjoining grid points can be sampled, however, the number of grid points additionally sampled in each direction must not be larger than the number of ghost points - 1 to avoid any segmentations faults. In the future we will improve this to allow a more flexible number of offset grid points.

  description: |
    The origin of the PALM model domain needs to be specified if the virtual sampling module is employed. The origin UTM coordinates (origin_x and origin_y) can be either specified via the static input file, or the sampling coordinate file. Note, an exact prescription of the origin coordinates is required to correctly locate the sampling grid points within PALM. Further, please note, in case of a nested run, the origin coordinates are different for each model domain.
