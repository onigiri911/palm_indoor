    When you have defined an overhanging structure in your topography data the simultaneous use of the Lagrangian particle model may give wrong results because reflection boundary conditions (as well as subgrid-scale velocities) are not realized for downward-facing walls so far.

    This error occurs when particle data from the [restart file](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/app/iofiles#PARTICLE_RESTART_DATA_OUT) is read and the precursor run was carried out with a different particle binary version than the main run. Repeat the precurser with the current version or carry out the main run with the same version as the precursor.
