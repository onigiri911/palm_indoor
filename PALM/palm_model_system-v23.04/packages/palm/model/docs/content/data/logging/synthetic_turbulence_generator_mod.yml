    synthetic turbulence generator is required if offline nesting is applied and PALM operates in LES mode
  description: |
    In order to trigger turbulence, synthetic turbulence need to be imposed at the lateral boundaries, else very larger adjustment zones in the order of O(10 km) are required.

    using synthetic turbulence generator requires bc_lr = "dirichlet/radiation", if not offline nesting is applied
  description: |
    The synthetic turbulence generator requires a non-cyclic boundary condition along `x` direction with an inflow at the left domain boundary.

STG0006:

  message: |
    using synthetic turbulence generator requires bc_ns = "cyclic", if not offline nesting is applied
  description: |
    The synthetic turbulence generator only supports non-cyclic boundary conditions at the left/right boundary. In north/south direction, cyclic boundary conditions must be set.

STG0007:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    input file "..." for synthetic turbulence generator is missing
  description: |
    Using the synthetic turbulence generator in idealized setups (no mesoscale nesting or self nesting), requires a STG_PROFILES file to have proper information about turbulent length and time scales, as well as Reynolds stress components. Please provide the respective turbulence data (derived from a precursor simulation or observations).

  message: |
    boundary_layer_depth = ... <= 0.0
  description: |
    For using parametrized turbulence (no STG_PROFILES file given) in a neutral simulation, the boundary-layer depth set via [boundary_layer_depth](../Namelists/#stg_par--boundary_layer_depth) must be > *0.0*.

  message: |
    using synthetic turbulence generator in combination with turbulent_inflow = .T. is not allowed
  description: |
    A turbulent inflow can only be generated by either the synthetic turbulence generator or the turbulence recycling method. Using both at the same time is impossible.

    compute_velocity_seeds_local = .FALSE. requires ratios nz / npex and nz / npey to be >= 1
  description: To distribute the computation of velocity seeds among the cores, each core computes velocity seeds for a dedicated range along the vertical direction. However, if the ratio of vertical grid points to the number of cores along the x- or y-direction is less than 1, the algorithm to distribute the workload does not work anymore. In order to avoid this, set compute_velocity_seeds_local = .TRUE., or alternatively, try to change the domain decomposition via the parameters npex and npey so that the ratios nz / npex and nz / npey are larger than 1.
