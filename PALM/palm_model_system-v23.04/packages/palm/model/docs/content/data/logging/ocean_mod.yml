    ocean mode not allowed for nesting
  description: |
    Nesting is not available for the ocean mode.

OCM0002:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    ocean mode does not allow cyclic-fill initialization
  description: |
    Main runs with [initializing_actions](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--initializing_actions) = *'cyclic_fill'* cannot use ocean mode so far.

OCM0003:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    ocean mode does not allow coupling_char = ... set by palmrun-option "-y"
  description: |
    The `palmrun` option `-y` must not be used for atmosphere runs. The option is only required for ocean precursor runs, which are followed by coupled atmosphere-ocean] restart runs.

OCM0004:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    use_top_fluxes must be .TRUE. in ocean mode
  description: |
    In ocean mode (see [ocean parameters namelist](../Namelists/#ocean-parameters)), fluxes at the water surface must be prescribed as driving boundary conditions. In atmosphere-ocean coupled runs, these fluxes are provided by the atmosphere run.

OCM0005:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    unknown boundary condition: bc_sa_t = "..."
  description: |
    See [bc_sa_t](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bc_sa_t) for allowed values.

OCM0006:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    salinityflux must not be set for ocean run without salinity
  description: |
    You have set [top_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--top_salinityflux) or/and [bottom_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bottom_salinityflux) to a non-zero value, and simultaneously switched off the salinity equation. Remove either the flux settings from your namelist file, or set [salinity](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--salinity) = *.TRUE.*.

OCM0007:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    boundary condition: bc_sa_t = "..." requires to set top_salinityflux
  description: |
    You have chosen a Neumann boundary condition for salinity at the top (by setting [bc_sa_t](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bc_sa_t) = *'neumann'*), but you did not provide a salinity flux at the top. Please provide [top_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--top_salinityflux) in the namelist file.

OCM0008:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    boundary condition: bc_sa_t = "..." is not allowed with top_salinityflux /= 0.0
  description: |
    You have tried to set both, a Dirichlet boundary condition for salinity at the top (by setting [bc_sa_t](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bc_sa_t) = *'dirichlet'*), and a salinity flux at the top (with [top_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--top_salinityflux) /= *0.0*). Please decide, if you like to give either the salinity or the salinity flux as top boundary condition, and omit one of the two parameters in the parameter file.

OCM0009:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    wrong settings for stokes_wavelength and/or stokes_waveheight
  description: |
    If you set parameters stokes_wavelength and stokes_waveheight to switch on the Stokes force in ocean mode, they must '''both''' be set > 0.0. Values < 0.0 are not allowed.

OCM0010:

  message: |
    wrong component of Stokes force: ...
  description: |
    Only the two Cartesian components 2 and 3 are allowed for the Stokes force in ocean mode.

  message: |
    wrong component of wave breaking: ...
  description: |
    Only the two Cartesian components 1 and 2 are allowed for adding wave breaking effects in ocean mode.
