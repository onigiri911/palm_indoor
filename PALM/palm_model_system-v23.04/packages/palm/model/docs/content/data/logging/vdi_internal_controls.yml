  message: |
    2-delta t waves are generated
  description: |
    The `u` component at a control grid point or the means of the meteorological variables exhibit 2 delta t waves (vdi_internal_controls).

VDI0002:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    maxima of the standard deviation remain at the open edges of the model
  description: |
    The maxima of the standard deviation of `u`, `v`, `w`, `pt` or `q` remain at the open edges of the model (see `vdi_internal_controls.f90`).

VDI0003:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    maxima of the standard deviation travel from the open edges into the interior of the domain with increasing simulation time
  description: |
    The maxima of the standard deviation of `u`, `v`, `w`, `pt` or `q` travel into the interior of the domain. Run does not fulfill VDI 3783 Part 9.

VDI0004:
  loglevel: WARNING
  message: |
    monotonic decrease or increase with increasing simulation time for ...
  description: |
    The mean of ... decreases or increases in the last 90% of time in the simulation. Maybe the simulation time is too short or there is a physical cause for this.

VDI0005:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    mass is not conserved
  description: |
    Conservation of mass is not fulfilled (see `vdi_internal_controls.f90`).

VDI0006:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    wind component ... has a magnitude greater than ten times the maximum horizontal wind velocity of the approach flow profile
  description: |
    The respective wind component exceeds the specified limit (see `vdi_internal_controls.f90`).

VDI0007:

  message: |
    potential temperature does not lie between 220 K and 330 K
  description: |
    The potential temperature exceeds the specified limit (see `vdi_internal_controls.f90`).
