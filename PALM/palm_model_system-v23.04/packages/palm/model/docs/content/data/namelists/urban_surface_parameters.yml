    short: Building type according to internal classification.
    long: |
      Building type according to internal classification my means of the year of construction and usage. This type is assumed for all buildings that are present in the simulation setup. Individual building types can be provided via [static driver file](https://palm.muk.uni-hannover.de/trac/wiki/doc/app/iofiles/pids#static_input) (see [building_type(#urban_surface_parameters--building_type) = *0*.
      
      At the moment six types of buildings are offered as outlined in the following table:

  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description: 
    short: Flag parameter to activate a thermal wall conductivity reduction.
    long: |
      This flag parameter activates a reduction of thermal conductivity of the outermost two wall layers during the spinup-mechanism by a factor of 10. This can become necessary to avoid model instabilities when long time steps shall be used during spin-up.
