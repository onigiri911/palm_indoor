# This is the YAML Database file for all allowed parameters within the namelist "biometeorology_parameters"
#

thermal_comfort:
  category: Mode
  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description:
    short: Switches on/off the calculation of thermal comfort indices.
    long: ''

clothing:
  category: General Settings
  type: I
  default:
    value: 1
  description:
    short: Choose clothing outfit for human model.
    long: |
      Steers the kind of outfit (and hence the exposed skin fraction) that is considered when calculating the UV exposure.
  allowed_values:
     - value: 0
       description: Fully exposed, i.e., no clothing and no hair.
     - value: 1
       description: Spring/summer outfit with exposed face, hands, and arms.
     - value: 2
       description: Winter outfit with exposed face and hands.

consider_obstructions:
  category: General Settings
  type: L
  default:
    value: .T.
  description:
    short: Switches on/off obstructions (e.g., from buildings and trees).
    long: |
      The obstructions are read from the input file [PIDS_UVEM](#iofiles--PIDS_UVEM) and must be calculated before starting the simulation.

orientation_angle:
  category: General Settings
  type: R
  default:
    value: 0.0
  si-unit: degree
  description:
    short: Orientation of front/face of the human model.
    long: |
      Setting of [orientation_angle](#biometeorology_parameters--orientation_angle) is only active if also [turn_to_sun](#biometeorology_parameters--turn_to_sun) = *.F.*.

sun_in_south:
  category: General Settings
  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description:
    short: Fixes the position of the sun to South.
    long: |
      If *.T.*, the azimuthal position of the sun is fixed to 180Â° (South).

      If *.F.*, the azimuthal position of the sun is calculated based on the date, time and location used in the simulation.
      See [origin_date_time](#initialization_parameters--origin_date_time), [latitude](#initialization_parameters--latitude), and [longitude](#initialization_parameters--longitude) to define the date/time and location.

      Please note, the solar azimuth angle (SZA) is never fixed and will always depend on the current simulation time.

switch_off_module:
  category: Mode
  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description:
    short: Switches on/off the entire module.
    long: |
       If *.T.*, the biometeorology module is not activated even if the namelist is present in the parameter file.

turn_to_sun:
  category: General Settings
  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description:
    short: Orientes the front/face of the human model towards the sun.
    long: |
      If *.T.*, the front/face of the human model is always oriented in the direction of the sun.

      If *.F.*, the front/face of the human model is oriented towards the direction defined by [orientation_angle](#biometeorology_parameters--orientation_angle).

uv_exposure:
  category: Mode
  type: L
  default:
    value: .F.
  description:
    short: Switches on/of the calculation of the UV exposure.
    long: ''
