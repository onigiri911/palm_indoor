This repository contains different versions of the PALM src, an LES model designed for meteorological applications, adapted for the indoor environment
The PALM source code adapted here will be used to simulate the indoor airflow inside a restaurant setting, track the evolution of aerosol in such settings with multiple occupants seated in different layouts and quantify airborne transmission in social settings.
